# DAVAR-OCR

This is the opensourced OCR repository of [DAVAR Lab](https://davar-lab.github.io/), from Hikvision Research Institute, China. 

We begin to maintain this code repository to release the implementations of our recent academic publishments and some re-implementations of previous popular algorithms/modules in OCR. 

We also provide some of the ablation experiment comparasions for better reproduction. 

A short paper introduces DavarOCR is available at [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06695.pdf). 

> Note: Due to the policy limits of the company. All of the codes were re-implemented based on the open-source frameworks, [mmdetection-2.11.0](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/releases/tag/v2.11.0) and [mmcv-1.3.4](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv/releases/tag/v1.3.4), from [open-mmlab](https://github.com/open-mmlab "open-mmlab"). The code architecture also refers to [mmocr](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmocr), which means these two frameworks can be well compatible to each other.

## Development Environment
The recommended environment requirements can be found in [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/). Follows are the lowest compatible environment.

| Basic Env   | version |
| :---------- | ------- |
| Python      | 3.6+    |
| cuda        | 10.0+   |
| cudnn       | 7.6.3+  |
| pytorch     | 1.3.0+  |
| torchvision | 0.4.1+  |
| opencv      | 3.0.0+  |

> For some of the algorithms (EAST, Text Perceptron), C++ version [opencv](https://opencv.org/) are required. If you do not need to use these algorithms, you could temporarily ignore the error about 'opencv.hpp' or remove the related codes temporarily.

## Installation and Development Instruction 

To Download the repository and install the davarocr, please follow the instructions:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/hikopensource/DAVAR-Lab-OCR.git
cd DAVAR-Lab-OCR/
bash setup.sh
```

This script will automatically download and install the "mmdetection" and "mmcv-full". You can also manually install them following the [official instructions](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/)

Going to the specific algorithm's directory to see more details.
